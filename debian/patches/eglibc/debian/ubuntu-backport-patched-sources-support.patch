Subject: [PATCH] Do not patch sources when PATCHED_SOURCES=yes is given

This patch is backport from Ubuntu where it got included in eglibc
2.12.1-0ubuntu1 package - LP: 612631

During build of eglibc there are several patches applied. Then eglibc-source
binary package is created - with patches sources and patches as separate files.

The problem appears when I try to cross build eglibc using data from
eglibc-source package - it fails on patching...
